Abstract 

The analysis of DNA microarry data is one of the most 
important things for functional  genomics  research. 
The  matrix representation  of microarray data and  its 
successive  ‘optimal’ 
incisional  hyperplanes is a 
useful platform for developing optimization algo바hms 
to determine the  optimal  partitioning  of pairwise 
proximity matrix representing  completely connected 
and  weighted  graph. We  developed  Deterministic 
Annealing (DA) approach to determine the successive 
optimal  binary partitioning.  DA  algorithm  demon(cid:173)
st빠ed good  pe야ormance with the ability to 헤nd the 
‘globally optimal’  binary partitions.  In  addition, the 
objects that  have  not  been  clustered  at small  non(cid:173)
zero temperature, 하e considered to be very sensitive 
to  even  small  randomness, and  can  be  used  to 
estimate the reliability of the clustering.

structure  of  complex  data  by  organizing  them  into 
meaningful  groups.  Genes  of a similar expression  pattern 
may  share  similar function, clustering  gene  expression 
profiles can  be  used for tentative assignment of functional 
annotation  of the  unknown  genes based on  the functional 
annotations  of  the  known  genes  (Eisen  et a/. , 1998). 
Cluster analysis  is also  useful  in  classi깨ing tissues on the 
basis  of  gene  expression.  Cancerous  and  normal  tissues 
can  be  distinguished  with  genes  of  subtle  differences  in 
gene expression (Alon et a/., 1999). Golub et a/. suggested 
molecular classification  of cancer  using  cluster analysis, 
which  categorizes  leukemia  into  acute  myeloid  leukemia 
(AM니 and  acute  Iymphoblastic  leukemia  (AL니 without 
prior knowledge  about their gene  expression  patterns 
(Golub et a/., 1999).  They also  developed  leukemia class 
predictor by  supervised  leaming  method  based  on  gene 
expression data. Since there is the correlation between the 
motif  existence  in  promoter  region  and  gene  expression 
profile, it has been  shown  that co-regulated  genes can  be 
identified by cluster analysis (Tavazoie and  Churφ ， 1998; 
Tavazoie et a/.,  1999). H이mes and Bruno considered gene 
expression  data  and  promoter sequences  simultaneously 
to find ∞-reg비ated genes by cluster analysis (H이mes and 
Bruno, 2000). 

The  matrix  representation  of  microarray data  and  its 
successive  ‘optimal’  incisional  hyperplanes  by  Kim  et a/. 
(Kim  et a/. , 2001)  constitutes  a useful  platform  for 
developing optimization algorithm to determine the optimal 
partitioning  of  pairwise  proximity  matrix  representing 
completely connected and weighted graph.  In this method, 
the  clustering  and  the  clustering  analysis  is  formulated  as 
an optimi경.tion problem whose global optimum is found by 
various  global  optimizers.  Previously, MITree  algorithm 
(Kim et a/., 2001) and evolution strategy (Lee et a/., 2001) 
are  applied  to  this  cluster  analysis.  Both  of  them 
demonstrated good pe얘ormances with the ability to find the 
‘globally optimal’  successive binary partitions.  MITree-K is 
a K-partitioning  e었ension of the  same  geometric principle 
(Kim et a/., 2002). 

In  this  paper, we  applied a heuristic global  optimization 
method, Deterministic  Annealing  (DA), to  the  same 
clustering  method.  In  DA  approach, the  cost  function  is 
locally  minimized  subject to  a constraint  on  a given 
randomness  (Shannon  entropy) ,  controlled  by 
‘ temperature’ 
that  is  gradually  lowered.  As  the 
temperature goes slowly down to zero, we obtain the best 
binary  partitioning  by  the  analogy  of  statistical  physics  in 

Global Optimization of Clusters in Gene Expression Data by Deterministic Annealing  21 

annealing  process.  Even  though  global  optimization 
approach  produces  the  high  quality  clustering  results, in 
general, it requires much computational COSt.  But, since the 
speed  of  DA  algorithm  depends  on  that  of  the  local 
optimizer, if we employ high pe야Ormance local optimization 
technique, the  computation  cost  can  be  substantially 
reduced.  It was also demonstrated that error-prone objects 
can  be  identified  by  monitoring  the  annealing  process, 
which  can  be  applied  to  increase  the  quality of  c/ustering 
analysis. 

Results and Discussion 
Fisher's  iris data 
The  Fisher' s iris  data  set  has  been  widely  used  for 
evaluating  the  performance  of  cluster algorithms  (Fisher, 
1936).  The  iris  data  set  consists  of  four  measurements 
(petaVsepallength and petal/sepal width) of 50 1(;심 Setosa, 
50  Iris  Versicolor, and  50  Iris  Virginica.  In  this  test, the 
sìmila끼ty measures between the iris flowers are the square 
values  of  the  pearson' s correlation  coefficient.  And, 
temperature cooling  parameter a is  equal  to 0.95.  As seen 
in  Fig.  1, the  first  binary  partitioning  separated  all  Setosa 
from  the  entire  data  set  without  any  error.  The  next 
partitioning of 50  Versicolor s and  50  Virginica’ s gave  rise 
to  six  errors.  Three  Versicolor s (objects  9, 12, 4이 were 
clustered to  ψrgJη'Íca and three  Virginica’  S  (0미ects 66, 77, 
81)  to  Versicolor.  The  overall  accuracy  of  clustering  was 
96% (144/15이. The repeated  results of our algorithm were 
thesame. 

The  Fig.  2 shows how X;  s are reduced to 0 or 1 as the 
temperature decreases to zero.  We see that X9, Xlι χ40，  and 
X59  are  reduced  to  0 or  1 slowly  relative  to  other  Xi’ s and 

these  variables  correspond  to  the  objects  misclassified  as 
above.  Because  the  misclassified  objects  might  be  near 
the  cluster  boundaries, they  are  very  susceptible  to 
randomness.  Hence, even  at  small  temperature, they  are 
not bounded and  easily agitated from  0 or 1. This concept 
is very helpful to find significant clusters which are robust to 
any  possible  errors  or  randomness.  In  addition, we  can 
reduce  computation  time  substantially  using  this  concept. 
Because the slowly relaxing variables may not contribute t。
clustering  qual때 and require great time-consumption to be 
relaxed to 0 or 1 as  Fig.  2, we can terminate the algorithm 
before  all  the  variables  are  reduced  to  0 or  1.  In  fact, we 
can use the f이lowing stopping criteria 
1) terminate  the  algorithm  if  pre-assigned  number of 
iteration is  reached.  And the  point whose value  remains 
the region {O < X < l} is regarded as an outlier, or 

2) terminate the algorithm if all X,'  s are in the neighborhood 
{O  :s:  X  < ê}  of  0 or  neighborhood {l  - E  < X  :s:  1} of  1, 
where  E  is a small  positive  pa떠meter (e.g.  ê  = 0.1) when 
pre-assigned number of iteration is reached 

Golub’'s leukemia data 
We also tested our algorithm using Golub’  s leukemia data 
set from  38  human  acute  leukemia cells, which  was  used 
for training class predictor of acute myeloid leukemia (AM니 
and  acute  Iymphoblastic  leukemia  (AL니 (G이ub et al., 
1999). The ALL group consists of T-cell ALL’ s (T-AL니 and 
B-cell  ALL’ s  (B-AL니. In  the  experiment, RNA  extracted 
from  each  leukemia sample was  hybridized to high density 
microarrays containing 6,817 human genes. After scanning 
the  microarrays  and  image  processing, the  expression 
levels of each gene for each  leukemia cell were quantified. 
It  has  been  shown  that  leukemia  class  prediction  was

feasible  by  this  gene  expression  monitoring  without 
additional  biological  knowledge.  Golub  et al.  selected  50 
genes  highly correlated  with  ALL-AML  class  distinction. 
The Fig. 3 demonstrates the results of our cluster algorithm 
applied  to  leukemia  data  using  the  50 genes.  The  first 
binary partitioning distinguished ALL from AML with 1 error, 
and  the  second  distinction  of  ALL  between  T ALL  and  B(cid:173)
ALL  gave  rise  to  1 error.  Two  B-ALL  samples  were  mis(cid:173)
classified  into  AML  and  T-ALL, respectively.  The  overall 
accuracy of the  result  was  94.7%  (36/38).  The  repeated 
results of our algorithm were the same. 

Discussion 
Due  to  the  recent  development  of  high-throughput 
experimental  techniques  in  functional  genomics, we  are 
facing  the  floOO  of  large-scale  gene expression  data.  The 
needs of analysis of such biological  data shed light on  the 
importance of cluster analysis, basic methodology to reveal 
internal  structure  of  complex data.  Because  cluster 
analysis  is the first  phase of mining  useful  information, the 
reliability  of cluste끼ng results  is  responsible  for the  quality 
of information  e었racted in  the following  stages.  The  direct 
maximization  of the fig.  아 merit (clustering  index)  which  is 
main difference with conventional cluster algorithms can be 
good  strategy  to  increase  clustering  quality.  We  have 
shown  that deterministic annealing  was  e유ectively applied 
to find globally optimal clusters.  Previously, we applied two 
different approaches  MITree  algorithm  and  evolution 
strategy to this problem and have the same results (Kim et 
al., 2001;  Lee et a/., 2001). We also find  possibility that we 
can  identi미 the  clustered  objects  that  are  susceptible  to 
errors or randomness  and  irrelevant to  increase clustering 
quality.  This concept  has good  possibility to  be  applied  to 

find  relevant  and  robust  clusters  and  reduce  computation 
time  substantially.- In  addition, our  approach  does  not 
needs  any  prior assumption  about  data structure  and 
considers gloOOI  perspective of data in  clustering.  We  can 
also  apply  this  algorithm  with  different clustering  indices 
and similarity measures, which  is not possible in algorithm 
dependent  methods  such  as  K-means  and  SOM.  Even 
though  the  computational  cost  is  quite  high  in  this 
preliminary study with iris and leukemia data sets, we have 
shown  that  our approach  is  promising  for the  further 
investigation with a variety 아 data sets, similarity measures 
and local optimization algorithms. 

Methods 
Data represen없Ition 
A set of DNA microarray experiments data can  be viewed 
as a completely connected and weighted graph of genes or 
arrays (i.e. , cell lines) with similarity measures. The vertices 
of the graph correspond to the objects to be clustered  and 
the edges represent the similarity between the objects. The 
similarity  measures  can  be  stored  in  pairwise  proximity 
matrix.  This  representation  makes  the  algorithm 
independent  of similarity  measures, while  the  other 
algorithms like  K-Means and SOM  (Self-Organizing  Maps) 
mingle with the given similarity measure. 

Clustering as an optimization problem 
The  cluster analysis  proposed  in  this  paper  is  done  by 
successive  binary  pa야itioning ，  which  produces  top-down 
hierarchical tree.  Binary partitioning dec이nposes the graph 
into two  parts with  optimized fig.  아 merit (clustering  index) 
called  MII  (Matrix  Incision  Index)  suggested  by  Kim  et a/. 
(Kim  et al., 2001).  The  MII  includes  homogeneity  and 
separ없ion of  binary  partition.  Homogeneity  ind때tes that 
each  object within  the  same  cluster should  have  high 
similarity.  On  the  other  hand, separation  means  that  the 
。이ects between clusters should have low similarity. These 
requirements are incorporated into MII as follows: 

MII== !J_찌(n+m)+c밴깐센 

(1 ) 

Q 

where m and n are the numbers 아 objects in groups 1 and 
2, respectively, a  is  the  average  link strength  between 
groups  1 and  2, b and  c are  within-group  average  link 
strength  of  group  1 and  2, respectively.  The  numerator of 
MII  corresponds  to  homogeneity, the  denominator to 
separation.  Since  homogeneity/ separation  should  be  as 
high/low  as  possible  in  binary  paπitioning ，  we  should 
maximize  the  MII.  The  index  is  defined  directly  from  the 
similarity  matrix without  prior  information  regarding  the 
structure of data set.  After defining the MII  , we should find

how to  get to  its  global  maximum.  Because  there  is  no 
general  and  rigorous  mathematical  method  for the  global 
optimization  problem, a feasible  way  is  to  use  heuristic 
methods to adopt randomness to escape local optima, one 
of which  is deterministic annealing  used  in  this  paper.  The 
advantage of global optimization of clustering is to increase 
clustering  quality  because  the  clustering  index  is  directly 
optimized differing from other algorithms such  as K-means 
and  SOM.  In  addition ,  we  do  not  have  any  prior 
assumption  about  data  structure.  One  possible 
disadvantage  is  that  this  global  optimization  algorithm 
might  be  relatively  slower than  other  local  optimization 
algorithms 

Deterministic  annealing  to  find  globally 
optimized clusters 
We  describe  a  heuristic  algorithm  creating  a  hierarchical 
tree  from  complex  data  by  iterative  optimal  binary 
partitioning, based  on  DA.  The best binary  pa야itioning can 
be  found  by  the  global  maximization  of  MII  introduced  in 
the  previous  section  as  a  clustering  index  (Eq.  1). 
Motivated  by the  annealing  process  of  heating  and  slowly 
cooling  materials  to  obtain  the  most  stable  structure, 
Kirkpatirck et al.  have proposed this stochastic optimization 
method  called  Simulated  Annealing  (SA)  in  an  attempt to 
find global optimum (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983). Using SA, the 
optimal  solution  is  randomly  searched  over the  cost 
function  landscape  with  higher probability  for  low  cost 
function.  As  the  temperature, the  parameter  representing 
randomness in searching decreases gradually, the solution 
is converged to global minimum. 

SA  was  applied  to  cluster  analysis  of  temporal  gene 
expression  profiles  and  finding  the  optimal  number of 
clusters  (Lukashin  et al. , 2001).  A deterministic version  of 
SA  called  Deterministic  Annealing  requires  much  less 
computational  cost because  stochastic simulation  in  SA  is 
replaced  by  the  corresponding  expectation  values.  The 
randomness  is  incorporated  into  cost  function  to  be 
minimized, and  the  function  is  locally  minimized  in  the 
course  of lowering temperature.  Rose et al.  applied  DA t。
the  central  clustering  analysis  which  requires  clustering 
centroids  as  K-means  algorithm  (Rose et al. , 1990;  Rose, 
1998) and it was used in analyzing tumor and normal colon 
cancer tissues  probed  by  이 igonucleotide arrays  (Alon  et 
al. , 1999). 

To  specify  data  pa 야ition ，  we  assign  0  or  1 to  each 
object.  Although  it  is  essentially  a discrete  (combinatorial) 
optimization  to  find  the  best  partitioning, the  problem  is 
transformed  into  a  continuous  version, if  the  clustering 
assignments denoted by χ are in the range [0, 1]. Here, Xi’ s 
denote  the  average  01  the  many  discrete  states  in 
stochastic simulation of the annealing pro∞ss. Using these 

average  clustering  assignments, we  can  represent  MII  as 
follows

(7) 

Here, Lij  is  similarity  between  object  i  and j , and  N  is  the 
number of objects to be partitioned. 

Instead of optimizing MII alone, we define free energy, F 
which  includes  randomness  of  clustering  as  follows, and 
carry out local optimization at given temperature, T. 

F  = -MII-TS 

where 

s = -2: {Xi log Xí  + (l-xi )log(l-xi )} 

(8) 

(9) 

Here, S is the  Shannon  entropy which  measures the  level 
of  randomness, and  T controls  randomness  of  clustering 
assignment  during  the  annealing.  We  carry  out  local 
optimization  at each  stage  of temperature cooling  process 
base on the optimization result from  previous temperature. 
As  the  temperature  goes slowly down, we  obtain  the  best 
binary  partitioning  by  the  analogy  of  statistical  physics  in 
annealing  process.  This  DA  approach  was  successfully 
applied  to Traveling  Salesman  Problem  (TSP)  by  Hopfield 
and Tank in a similar manner (Hopfield and Tank, 1985). 

We  can  re-interpret  this  problem  from  the  viewpoint  of 
constraint optimization.  Here, we  should  minimized  the 
object function, -MII  subject to  the  constraint, S=O, which 
requires  every  Xi  should  be  0  or  1.  To  deal  with  such  a 
constraint  optimization  problem, we  define  Lagrangian 
function  which  is  the  same  as  free  energy, Eq.  8  with 
undetermined  Lagrangian  multiplier, T.  We  can  find 

24  Genomic5 &  Informatic5 Vol.  1 (1) 20-24, 8eptember 2003 

extrema  of  constraint  object function  and  Lagrangian 
multiplier, T by the condition, <J F/<JXi  = <J F/<JT = O.  If minimal 
point of -MII is located at the corner of hypercube defined by 
{Xi  I 0 < Xi  < 1}, the  critical  temperature  is  positive.  On  the 
other  hand, the  minimum  point  located  at the  middle  of 
hypercube  results  in  negative  critical  temperature, differing 
from  what we see  in  statistical  physics.  The  annealing can 
be seen to find such critical points of Lagrangian function as 
it scans given range of T. 

To  find  globally  optimized  binary  partitioning , we

improving feasible direction of the line search is determines 
by  calculating  gradient of  cost function  in  the  feasible 
region  {Xi  I 0 <  Xi  <  1}.  At  the  boundary  of  the  feasible 
region, the generation of the  improving feasible direction is 
done by solving a sub-problem of linear programming.
